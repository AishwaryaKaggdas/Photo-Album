# Photo-Album

This project entailed creating and launching a Photo Album website using AWS infrastructure. I configured a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with specific subnets, routing tables, and security groups to manage access through an Internet Gateway. I customized the PHP code to create a website that stores photo metadata in a MySQL database managed by Amazon RDS, enabling photo search and display. The website was hosted on an Apache web server running on an EC2 instance within the VPC. Key tasks included creating an S3 bucket for photo storage, ensuring public access through appropriate policies, and establishing an RDS instance in private subnets.
